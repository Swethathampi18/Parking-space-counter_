# Problem Statement
Finding and keeping track of parking spots in busy cities is a tough problem that causes trouble for both people driving and those in charge of the parking areas. Old ways of checking parking spaces are not very effective and usually depend on people checking manually or using old technology. The Parking Space Counter project aims to fix this by offering a real-time solution that makes it easier to see and manage parking spots using automatic image processing.
# Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes the design and development of a real-time parking space detection system using computer vision. It encompasses the following aspects:
1) Real-time video analysis: The project processes live video feeds to identify parking space occupancy.
2) User interaction: It allows users to manually select parking spaces for personalized management.
3) Visual representation: The system presents occupancy status through intuitive visual indicators.
4) Data persistence: User configurations are saved for future sessions to streamline on-the-fly adjustments.
# Target Users
1) Drivers
2) Parking Facility Managers
3) Urban planners
# High-Level Features
1) Real-Time Occupancy Detection: The system provides instant feedback on parking space status, allowing users to see which spots are available or occupied at any time.
2) Interactive User Interface: A straightforward interface makes it easy for users to select and manage parking spaces with minimal effort, streamlining the user experience.
3) Visual Indicators: Color-coded overlays on the video feed differentiate between free (green) and occupied (red) spaces, facilitating quick decision-making.
4) Data Persistence: User selections are saved to ensure a personalized experience across different sessions, eliminating the need for repeated configuration.
5) Performance Efficiency: Optimized for real-time processing, the system ensures that users receive updates with minimal latency, thus enhancing usability in dynamic parking environments.
