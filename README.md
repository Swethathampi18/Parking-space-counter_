# Parking-space-counter_
# Overview
The Parking Space Counter project aims to implement a real-time system that detects and counts available parking spaces using computer vision techniques. Utilizing OpenCV and basic image processing methods, this project focuses on accurately identifying whether parking spots are occupied or free.
# Features
1) Real-Time Detection: Constantly evaluates video streams to determine whether parking spots are occupied.
2) Easy-to-use Interface: From the video feed, users can manually choose and reject parking spots.
3) Visual Feedback: Provides quick access to parking availability by displaying color-coded rectangles (green for free, red for occupied).
4) Data Persistence: Uses the pickle library to store user-selected parking configurations, making retrieval simple in subsequent sessions.
5) Performance Monitoring: Minimizes latency while tracking available parking spaces in real time.
# Technologies/Tools Used
1) Programming Language: Python
2) Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pickle
3) Development Environment:PyCharm, Visual Studio Code
4) Operating System: Windows
# Steps to Install & Run the Project
1) Clone the Repository: Download the project files from the GitHub repository.
2) Install Required Packages: Use pip to install the necessary libraries.
3) Run the Application: Execute the main script to start the parking space counter.
4) Setup: Configure parking spaces using the parking space picker script.
# Instruction for Testing
1) Launch the Application: After running the application, the camera feed will start displaying.
2) Select Parking Spaces: Click on the video feed to select or deselect parking spaces.
3) Observe Live Updates: Watch as the occupancy status updates in real time with visual markers indicating free or occupied spaces.
4) Review Data Persistence: Restart the application to ensure that the selected configurations are retained.
